## Annealing: Implement the Knapsack problem with the DQM solver
The knapsack problem can be formally defined as follows: We are given an item set N, consisting of n items j with profit Pj and weight Wj, and the capacity value c.Then the objective is to select a subset of N such that the total profit of the selected items is maximized and the total weight does not exceed c. In this work, the Bounded Knapsack Problem, where we are allowed to take multiple pieces for each item so the variable can take discrete values 0,1,2,... up to b, is solved using the Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM) solver. With a direct application in stock portfolio optimization.

In future works, we can add more constraints,  add m knapsacks with different capacities or optimize the Unbounded Knapsack Problem where an unlimited amount of each item is available.

Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
